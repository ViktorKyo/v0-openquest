      'Schmidt Sciences AI2050 supports visionary researchers working on the hardest and most important questions in AI — the kind of interdisciplinary, high-risk work that traditional funders often overlook.',

    summary:
      'The AI2050 program, backed by Schmidt Sciences (the philanthropic initiative of Eric and Wendy Schmidt), funds researchers tackling the most consequential open questions in artificial intelligence. The program is built on the premise that AI will be one of the most transformative technologies of the century, and that answering fundamental questions about its trajectory, safety, and societal impact requires bold, interdisciplinary thinking.\n\nAI2050 offers two fellowship tracks. The Senior Fellowship is aimed at established researchers who have demonstrated exceptional leadership in AI-related fields, while the Early Career Fellowship targets promising scholars earlier in their academic journey. Both tracks provide generous, flexible funding designed to free researchers from the constraints of short grant cycles and narrow disciplinary silos.\n\nThe program specifically seeks out work that bridges disciplines — combining computer science with philosophy, neuroscience, economics, law, or other fields — to address questions about AI alignment, robustness, fairness, and long-term impact. Past fellows have worked on topics ranging from mathematical foundations of deep learning to the socioeconomic consequences of automation.',

    summary:
      'Mozilla\'s fellowship program is one of the most respected programs at the intersection of technology and public interest. Since its inception, it has supported hundreds of fellows who have gone on to shape policy, build tools, and lead movements around digital rights, AI accountability, online privacy, and open-source technology.\n\nThe program runs two tracks. Embedded Fellows are placed with partner organizations — such as newsrooms, civil liberties nonprofits, or research labs — where they work on specific projects aligned with Mozilla\'s mission. Independent Fellows pursue their own self-directed projects, with mentorship and support from the Mozilla network. Both tracks receive a competitive stipend, a dedicated project budget, and access to Mozilla\'s global community of technologists and advocates.\n\nMozilla Fellows work on some of the most pressing challenges in tech today: AI governance, algorithmic transparency, data privacy, content moderation, and the digital divide. The program is particularly well-suited for people who sit at the intersection of technical expertise and social consciousness — those who want to build a better internet, not just a more profitable one.',

    summary:
      'Google DeepMind, widely regarded as one of the world\'s leading AI research laboratories, established its scholarship program to invest in the next generation of AI researchers. The program funds postdoctoral scholars to conduct independent research at top UK universities, with the explicit goal of advancing fundamental understanding of intelligence — both artificial and biological.\n\nUnlike many industry-funded programs, the DeepMind Scholarship emphasizes academic independence. Scholars are not expected to work on DeepMind\'s internal projects or produce commercially relevant outputs. Instead, they are encouraged to pursue ambitious, curiosity-driven research that pushes the boundaries of what we know about machine learning, neuroscience, mathematics, and related fields.\n\nThe scholarship covers the full cost of the postdoctoral appointment — including salary, tuition or bench fees, research expenses, and conference travel — removing financial barriers so scholars can focus entirely on their work. Scholars also benefit from informal connections to the DeepMind research community, including opportunities to attend seminars, visit DeepMind\'s London offices, and collaborate with DeepMind researchers on a voluntary basis.',
