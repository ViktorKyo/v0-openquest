    summary:
      'The Echoing Green Fellowship is one of the most prestigious launch-stage programs for social entrepreneurs worldwide. Since 1987, the organization has invested over $60 million in more than 900 social enterprise leaders, including the founders of Teach For America, City Year, SKS Microfinance, and the Innocence Project.\n\nFellows receive $100,000 in seed funding over 18 months, along with leadership development, technical assistance, and access to a powerful global network of social innovators. The fellowship specifically targets leaders at the earliest stages — those with a bold idea and a plan but who have not yet launched or are within the first two years of operation.\n\nWhat sets Echoing Green apart is its emphasis on investing in the leader as much as the idea. The selection process evaluates not just the viability of the social enterprise, but the founder\'s lived experience, resilience, and connection to the community they aim to serve.',

Since 1973, more than 4,000 fellows have served in Congress, federal agencies, and the judiciary, bringing scientific expertise to policy decisions that affect millions of lives.\n\nFellows are placed in offices across the federal government — from the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health to the State Department, USAID, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. They serve as technical advisors, helping policymakers understand scientific evidence, evaluate emerging technologies, and design evidence-based programs. At the same time, fellows gain a deep understanding of how policy is made, building skills that many scientists never develop in academic careers.\n\nThe fellowship has produced an extraordinary alumni network that spans academia, government, industry, and the nonprofit sector. Many AAAS fellows go on to permanent government careers, senior policy roles, or leadership positions where they continue to bridge the gap between science and society. The program is widely credited with improving the quality of science-informed policymaking in the US government.',
