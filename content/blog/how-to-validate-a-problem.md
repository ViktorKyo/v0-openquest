## The Biggest Mistake Founders Make

Most failed startups don't fail because of bad execution. They fail because they solved a problem nobody had — or one that wasn't painful enough to pay for.

Problem validation is the single most important step in the startup journey, yet it's the one most founders skip.

## The Three Tests

Before writing a single line of code, every problem should pass three tests:

### 1. The Reality Test

Is this a problem people actually have, or one you imagine they have?

Talk to at least 20 people in your target audience. Don't pitch your solution — ask about their workflow, their frustrations, their workarounds. If the problem is real, they'll describe it without prompting.

### 2. The Pain Test

How painful is this problem on a scale of 1-10? Problems scoring below 7 rarely support a business. People tolerate mild inconveniences. They pay to eliminate real pain.

Look for these signals:

- People are already paying for imperfect solutions
- People have built internal tools or spreadsheets to work around it
- People get emotional when describing the problem

### 3. The Frequency Test

How often does this problem occur? A problem that happens once a year, no matter how painful, is harder to build around than one that occurs daily.

The ideal problem is:

- **Real** (people confirm it unprompted)
- **Painful** (they've tried to solve it already)
- **Frequent** (it disrupts their workflow regularly)

## What's Next?

Once a problem passes all three tests, you've earned the right to think about solutions. Not before.
